        <h1>Welcome to the BioControl Group</h1>
        <p>We work at the intersection of biology, mathematics and computer science to deliver solutions to
            live in a better world.
        </p>
        <p>Our research is focused on developing quantitative tools to understand cell dynamics and engineering-inspired methodologies for controlling living system functions, with the final aim to both disentangle and reprogram the complexity governing life.
            Her approach combines tools from different disciplines: control engineering, systems and synthetic biology, and computer science.</p>
